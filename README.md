# AI-Powered-Fraud-Detection-System
This project leverages machine learning and data analytics to detect fraudulent credit card transactions with high precision. The system uses advanced models such as Random Forest and Logistic Regression, combined with feature engineering and data balancing (SMOTE) techniques, to identify anomalies in large transaction datasets.

# Overview
This project aims to build a robust classification system capable of distinguishing between legitimate and fraudulent credit card transactions. The model is trained on a large anonymized transaction dataset and optimised for precision, recall, and interpretability â€” ensuring effectiveness in real-world financial environments.

# Dataset
Source: Publicly available anonymized credit card transaction dataset

Size: 284,807 transactions with 492 confirmed fraud cases

Characteristics: Highly imbalanced data; numerical features transformed via PCA

Handling Imbalance: Compared SMOTE vs ADASYN to balance classes
